    I am often asked about the gear I use as a software developer and content
    creator. The hardware and software I use is changing all the time so this
    page will serve as a place for an updated list. If you have a question about
    anything I use or a suggestion for something I am missing please reach out

    As I mentioned on a blog entry you can find on this same web page, the main
    intention of this portfolio being built in a technology I do not feel
    comfortable with initially, was a challenge I wanted to acomplish for
    personal purposes but also to show that once you understand the basics of a
    language, becoming proficient using a framework that uses that language, is
    a matter of personal discipline, knowing how to gather the right data and
    practicing It on a real basis.
