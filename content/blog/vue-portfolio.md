# Vue Portfolio

Deciding what framework to use in building up my portfolio took me a while, but I decided to make It on Vue, helping with videos and documentation. But why? If I have experience as a React developer, why not using what I have experience on?. Well, actually that was the idea, I work currently in projects involving pure React and It's use in Next 14, and I learn something everyday by working on It. I also wanted my portfolio to look cool but to be a 'showdown' of my abilities. And here comes a secret about me: _I like to be visible for the chanllenges I take and complete, rather than for what I am already good on._

The intention of this portfolio is to show my idea of programming: Once you have understood how the basics work, learning a new 'way' to apply those basics It's just a time to read previous experience with It (docs, for example), and then give It a try on a real application. You'll need to go through the problems you may encounter when building a real world application, otherwise you won't know what to do once you use that new 'way' in a job or project. Vue, Spring, Angular, React... all of them have their own complexity and solutions, but they all base on the same: JS/TS and HTML with the use of an particular approach for building web apps (or more) with their unique advantages.

Using Vue was not simple, and what could've taken me around two to three days maxto build a porftolio on React, extended for a whole week while I had issues understanding Vue tags and Nuxt 'simplification', and also trying to use GraphQL in a basic way to query project data from gitHub. But I am really happy with the result: Does this mean I consider myself a Vue developer? Well, yes and no, let me explain. I don't see something as a 'Vue' developer a valid title, I think that there are web developers with experience with Vue, in that case I'll say yes. But at the same time, I just built a basic app, and took me a while to understand how everything worked. I do not consider myself a developer with enought experience in Vue for me to go and work with It directly.

Then what does this mean for me? **This means that even though I'm not proficient with Vue, I know that I have the tools and self-discipline to become an experienced Vue developer If I need to**, and not only with Vue (which I know existed but hadn't used at all until I planned to build this portfolio), also I know I can do that with any other webDev framework out there. Obviously, not every framework would take the same time, but time is not a varrier to a disciplined person.
