# Incoming and Ongoing projects

## LinkIT

I'm currently ending a 1-year project with an IT company Argentina based, which works connecting talent to companies searching for IT talent. At first, company needed just a web page to show information they had in their own data system, connected to Airtable, but as the progress went really fast, they decided It was better and more efficient to manage everything from the webpage, which led to back-End team which I was part of (3 people total), started to create a CRM-like system to manage User status per each offer, an admin panl with similarities to trello relation and visuals, and more. We keep working on last details which are mainly visual tiny details so we can deliver fully the webpage by the end of December.

**Tech on Front-End:** TypeScript, Tailwind, React, Redux-Toolkit, SweetAlert2, FramerMotion, i18next, chart.js & Vite.
**Tech on Back-End:** Express, Airtable (as DB integration), Mongoose, NodeMailer, TypeScript, Firebase Auth, MongoDB and Cloudinary.

### What was challenging about this project?

Team is actually really great so new integrations on frameworks are not hard at all. As I was on the back-end mainly (also did Front-End on chart.js and Admin Panel), thedata schema so relations can be done with mongoose was a bit challenging, mostly because statuses per user require a specific data flow, and the requirement that all that information once modified on the webpage needs to go to airtable added complexity to the task. Anyway, It was accomplished really well. By the time we decided to use Mongoose as our ORM, we did not know Atlas existed, which would've decreased the difficulty.

## Honey Pony

With a 30% of completition, this project will be the e-commerce for an instagram vintage shop which needs to expand their digital impact and also, get faster processes from client interest to a real purchase. This company is Colombia based, and the project is planned to be fully working by the beginning of 2024, with MercadoPago integration for buying and also, as for the client request, customizable appearance depending on the year's events or disccounts.

**Tech on Front-End:** TypeScript, Tailwind, React, Zustand, SweetAlert2, NextUI, Next 14. (For now, still in construction)
**Tech on Back-End:** Next 14, NextAuth, JWT, Prisma and MongoDB, Cloudinary, TypeScript and Bcrypt.

### What is challenging about this project?

Next 14 was recently launched and by using It, might be risky to integrate some other frameworks and avoid issues a recent version could have. Anyway, for now everything is going smooth, and I consider this a much easier project compared to Link-IT one, with the exception that this project I'll be doing It all by myself. For now, no major challenges, I'll be updating when more progress comes for this project.

## FG Capital

This is just a concept for now, as soon as I finish HoneyPoney project, I'll be starting a project with FG capital, a company I worked as a dev on 2022-2023 and also the one I work as a finance teacher and risk-management director with my own schedule, which It's not demanding at all. Anyway, this idea is a personal project but also a requirement the company gave me when they redirected me to Henry bootcamp, so I will honor my word on this, and I'm actually really excited. For this project my idea is to use Java on the back-end construction (I'm currently studing It on SLU and also on my own), and I may want to use Angular for Front-End construction. Right now is an idea, I'm building Minecraft Mods with Java to start by practicing that language a bit, and then I will continue with a back end practice using Java. Once I have that kind of completed, I will start taking a look into Angular to see If It fits the web-page requirements.
