# Why did I choose to program? ðŸ”‘

Want the long story? No? Ok, then I'll just say that I discovered a passion about programming while I was doing something unrelated to the actual career, eventhough my experiences and skills told others I had a clear road for becoming a developer, I was the only one not being able to see It that clearly.

For those who want the long story, here we go...

## Programming was not on my plans

I've been always (at least since I have memory), close to technology and passionate about creating things. I loved to destroy stuff, mostly toys, and then rebuild them -as many other childs- but once I started sharing a LOT of time with a computer, I transfered that energy into It. It started with simple games, trying to understand how It worked, trying to remove file by file and see what happened while the game was running. Then I moved into 'cheating' on games, which is not really particular, unless we talk about a small comunity I had on Taringa! (something like reddit but around 2005), where I shared some basic hacks I learned to create by copying files from already created ones. That exploration on technology continued to the point I could spent hours creating mods for some games or even trying to build something really complicated with redstone on Minecraft, for expample.

Anyway, I finished highschool and It was time to decide what would I choose as my career. I had a slight idea about studying programing at that time but the only interaction I had with people who studied something related to computers and technology in that moment, was the guy who repaired our computer, and I was not really excited with that. At school my grades were good, but specially in maths and physics, which I found very easy actually, and that made me follow the (kinda forced) recommendation from my father of studying an engineering. And there I was, starting a career as an Oil Engineer with more expectations that enthusiasm. I learnt a lot,but the only thing I really learnt from that experience was that I loved to program.

And how did I notice? Well, let's say that from all the subjects I had to asist, the only one I never missed a single class and I was eager to see next, was programming. I was surprised by It, I mean, I was not a bad student, but I really hated to go to class. And I had good grades but every teacher had warned me to not miss again a class (as I did a lot) or I will fail the subject. Well, every teacher but my programming teacher, obviously. He noticed my enthusiasm soon, and offered me some off-schedule classes to improve in basic C++, which led me to be the 'do-my-homework' student on his class, which was a very profitable activity, I may say.

A year later I dropped that University and started taking classes with my ex programming teacher for a while, he then moved to another country and we just lost communication, but Iam really grateful for his effort on teaching me a LOT of things I enjoyed to learn. Years went by and as an 'University-deserter' I had to start looking for a way to earn money and then study what I really wanted to. On that road I used my math and logic abilities to build a self-taught career in finance and mid-risk investments, I ended up being a teacher in an US Academy for investing in financial markets using CFDs instrument, and I am now the risk-management director of a financial company I created on 2019, and started as a teacher in the same company mid-2023. But as It happens with anything in life, things started to complicate a lot due to European recession and I learnt the bad way that you may never trust a single income.

Around 2021, I started studying programming again in a University in my country, but as my grades were really good, I had the oportunity to start my career in an United Stated based University, thankfully in a virtual modality. I'm currently a student of Saint Leo FL University, studying to become a Software Engineer, and when life decided to slap me a bit, I asked to myself: Why not start programming right now? I mean, I will do It once I finish my career, but why not now?

**OK cool story but why?**

I have a lot of ideas on how to combine my two passions, finance and programming, into a huge concept that can leave a big print in the world, but first I need to become an expert, to know people who is going to help me with It, and to know the environment I will change. That is going to take years, even decades, I'm not in a hurry, _I learnt by hurrying that you can be on the same point you started If you are not paying enought attention._

Absolutely, I will be working at an important role at that time, and I'll start materializing my own ideas to create a company for sure.
